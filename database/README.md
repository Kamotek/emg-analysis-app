## How to run ##

Run this or similar command
python -m database.main

Install all requirements (probably we should make some requirements.txt file or share Pipfile directly XD)

## Note: ##

In a public repo, the file client_secrets.json should not be uploaded.
If we go public with the app, we should think of some CI/CD like Github Actions or Google Cloud Secret Manager to store the client_secrets.json file.
